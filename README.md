This is a Pomodoro-type app made in Java using Swift UI.

## How to use
1. Click on "Start timer" and input how many minutes you want to focus. 
    * If you provide an invalid value, it will be defaulted to 25 minutes.
2. To skip the session, click on "Stop timer".
3. When the timer reaches 00:00, the break will begin. 
4. Click on "Start timer" to start the break.

From now on, you will get a focus session, break, focus session, break and so on until you close the app.
